# *\<Component Name>* Design Document
*NOTE: Text in italics should be replaced with your own content.*

## Introduction

*High level description of this document, for example: This document defines the design for the Canonical Model.*

## Overview

*Overview of the problem to be solved. What is the problem and why is it being solved? How will the resulting solution provide business value?*

*Consider adding a diagram that explains how this component fits into the overall System with some descriptive text explaining the diagram.*

### *\<System name>* Components Diagram (Optional)
#### The *\<System name>* is build with the following components
* 


*\<LEVELED COMPONENTS DIAGRAM GOES HERE>*

## Requirements
This section defines the requirements for the *Mobile Application Store Product API.*

*Provide your understanding of the requirements, both functional and nonfunctional. Reference the provided Requirements and System Architecture documents. Do not cut and paste from the requirements document.*

*Product Manager and others can read this to understand what requirements your design will support. There is already a requirements doc, so keep this brief and to the point, highlighting the important requirements that the design is addressing. Structure in a way to provide a requirements checklist for your design.*

*Section can be extracted to own markdown file if necessary*

## Use Cases

*Enumerate the use cases supported by the design. Enumberate using Gherkin style scenarios.* 
### This design supports the following use cases
* 

*\<USE CASE DIAGRAM GOES HERE>*

## Code Example, Activity, or Sequence Diagrams (Optional)
*Complex pieces of code can be described with activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, or high level code. High level code should only be used for synchronous code*

## Implementation

This section of the document will describe the implementation details for *\<Component>*. 

*The implementation section should cover the following topics:*
* _What are the classes, and their properties, associations and methods?_

* _What are the important interfaces and how they will be implemented?_

* _How are the requirements addressed?_

### Class Diagram

The following class diagram defines the classes defined in this design. *Remember to include exception classes.*

*\<CLASS DIAGRAM GOES HERE>*

### Class Documentation

Classes are documented with *\<JAVADOC OR EQUIVELANT>* *[here.]()*


## Implementation Details

*Explain details of the implementation.*

*How do the various parts fit together or interact?*

*How does the design address the requirements? Justify your design decisions and how they address the requirements.*

*Some implementation details may be addressed in the class dictionary, but for things that are not, describe them here.*

*Remember to reference the requirements from the body of the design document to show how your design is addressing the requirements.*

## Exception Handling

*Provide details on your exception handling. What types of exceptions are expected and how are they handled by the design? Describe your exception classes and their properties.*

## Testing

*Provide a testing strategy for testing the component.*

### Functional Testing

### Performance Testing

### Regression Testing

### Exception Handling Testing

## Risks

*Document any risks identified during the design process.*

*Are there parts of the design that may not work or need to be implemented with special care or additional testing?*
